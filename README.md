# Add Toxic room summary
I add a toxic room. When hero walk into this room, he will play a dice game. If he win, nothing will happen, if he lost, he can at most play n(config) more steps, then he will die. He should leave the entrance before n steps.


# Add Monstor summary
I designed a monstor that can destory the empty room(no feature room, no monstor, not destoryed), if the hero meet the destory room, he/she cannot move, will stay at orignal place one round. if the hero cannot exit before all the room destoryed, the he/she lost the game. My monstor name is FireDragon, it not only can use fire to destory the room, but also can case spell and copy it self, it is a very powerful monstor, I think the hero will most likely lost the game.

# TODO
Can design another types of desotryable monstor, for example water monstor. And aslo need to design a room that can let hero pick up some tools that can respair the room and make the hero more powerful.
